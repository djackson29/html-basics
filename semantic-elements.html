  <h1>My Favorite Movies: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
  <h2>Movies</h2>
  <p><em>Movies are the best!</em><br> Some of my favorites are <strong>Gladiator</strong>, Runaway Bride, <u>Step Brothers</u>, Bridesmaids, and Pride and Prejudice.</p>
  <h3><small>TV Shows</small></h3>
  <p><q>TV Shows have more time for character development but often times, they go on too long and the original scope of the show is lost.</q> Shows are also a much longer time commitment than movies.</p>
  <h4>Conclusions</h4>
  <blockquote>In conclusion, I love both movies and tv shows.</blockquote>
  <p>But I am more likely to commit to a movie than a show.</p>
